How much lending did I originate? In which industry sectors my lending exposure is growing / shrinking the fastest. What does my industry and geographical concentration looks like and does it pose a risk? Where are my RWA is largest? Where is my capital being used inefficiently? What assets have I distributed to investors and what products have I used? How can I distribute more? Etc.
